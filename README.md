# CS-370---Current-Emerging-Trends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Project 2 of the course involved creating a Deep Q newtork inside of a treasure hunting game. The code provided was the intitial python files for game stup and gameplay. These files helped set the rules and boundaries for the game within the program. The other code provided was the skeleton of the program. From this blueprint, I created a Deep Q Network to train the systembased on gameplays to reach the desired end state of the game. Through this development, weights(rewards) were placed on each state of the game to allow the system to "learn" from its runs to explore the environment, then to exploit it based on the data collected. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are the people behind the entire aspect of how technology works and how to manipulate and evolve it. A computer scientist is involved from beginning to end in the software development lifecycle and. From planning and requirements gathering to the development, testing, and rolout f technology, computer scientists are there throughout. By thinking of the technology and its limitations and possibilities, a computer scientist strives to get the most out of a technology, while studying it and trying to imporve it as well. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems very differently than I did before pursuing my CS degree. As a computer scientist, I look at a problem in an analytical way, while still being open to out of the box thinking. This process of combining two modes of thought allows me to truly understand the problem and what I am trying to resolve. After understanding the problem at hand, I am able to break it down into compartmentalized portions in order to work iteratively on the tasks. This approach is similar to how the SDLC approaches a new project or problem as well. Iteration of a problem allows one to work through it and fix pieces of it and put it back together once all parts are addressed. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibility to the end user is to provide a product that meets or exceeds the expectations of it. I am responsible for ensuring the privacy, safety, and trust of the end user is the top priority of myself and the product.
